# SNORT - A Combinatorial Game Example
A basic example of  SNORT, which is a common combinatorial game theory test.
In SNORT, two players take turns coloring in spots on a graph. Each player cannot
put their color next to a spot on the graph that is taken by the other player.
The first player to run out of moves loses.
